Student Debt,"While it would be ideal to be able to attend college for free or without incurring debt, the truth is that student loans are frequently required for people seeking a higher education, especially given the rate at which college tuition continues to rise. Over the last decade, the student debt crisis has grown by 144%, putting 45 million Americans on the hook for $1.7 trillion in loans. Increasing tuition costs and uncontrolled borrowing aren't helping the situation. ""The student loan system is saddling millions of students and families with debt that harms their long-term financial security and well-being,"" Kevin Miller, BPC associate director of higher education, said in a statement. ""And when borrowers cannot repay their loans, the federal government and taxpayers foot the bill. We need reforms to protect students as well as taxpayers from the negative consequences of excessive student debt.” Loan forgiveness and limits on the amount of federal student debt that borrowers can take on have been the subject of political discussions. However, unless new legislation is passed, debtors are likely to face an ever-increasing debt load in the future.",Main,images/debt.jpg
Govermental Efforts,"Higher education in the United States has always been regarded as a beneficial investment for many individuals and the general public, despite the fact that disparities in educational investment returns across schools were sometimes exaggerated. Here, students and their families fund much of college through loans, though public institutions are funded in part through state and local taxes, and both private and public institutions through Pell grants, gifts from donors and alumni, and investment earnings, especially at older schools.",Subtopic,images/congress.png
Ranking,The conception of student loans that eventually blossomed to the monstrosity that we see today is because of America’s desire to always be a global superpower. Ranking plays a huge role on American politics and agenda and this industry is not immune. ,Subtopic,images/flags.png
Capitalism,"College loans are approaching $2 trillion as the semesters go on, which is more than all homeowners owe on their credit cards combined. Fully two-thirds of our undergraduates are in debt, many of whom come from middle-class families that previously paid for much of college out of savings. Try this one if you want to make a name for yourself as an economic clairvoyant. Defaults on student indebtedness, beginning with for-profit colleges and progressing to the Ivy League, will be the next subprime disaster. There is, nevertheless, a distinction. Banks take and resell homes when borrowers default on their mortgages. The banks are unconcerned whether a degree cannot be sold. They drafted the student loan legislation, which states that they are not ""dischargable."" The payments will continue to be payable even if you file for bankruptcy. ", which is more than all homeowners owe on their credit cards combined. Fully two-thirds of our undergraduates are in debt,images/capitalism.jpg
Typical Payment,"There are several ways that a student can pay for their student loans. Listed here are the typical payments of doing so but is not limited. Some pursue to enroll in the US military, some engage in gap years to work, while some will undergo unforeseen circumstances with possible financial instabilities.",,images/payment.png
Trans Generational Problem,"The student loan crisis is a problem that transcends beyond generations. Through egregiously outdated legislation in minimum wage, tax regulation, and lack of oversight on such bureaucracies, the burden to pay outstanding student loans relies more primarily on the borrowers than the government. Cultural values, myths, and disappointing fallacies might also be the culprit too.",,images/americandream.png
Entertainment,"There were some instances that people’s suffering with student debt has been turned into an entertaining matter. While it is extremely insensitive, such events produce a stark commentary between the working class, the middle class, and the upper class.",Point,images/entertainment.png
Paid Off Show ,"Paid Off with Michael Torpey gives three college grads—each saddled with student debt—the chance to test the value of their education in a fun, fast-paced trivia contest. In the end, one lucky winner will have the chance to win the sum of their debt in cash. Torpey, the host and creative force behind the show, champions that he agrees with the idea that the show is dystopian, but views it as a form of satire.",Point,images/paidoff.png
March Madness,"Student loan servicers like Navient are well known for providing inadequate customer service. With providing such a disservice, they could maximize their profits by limiting call length times, not providing enough information, and consciously giving out overpromised statutes. In companies like Navient, their customer service has gotten so extremely bad to the point that they treat customers’ problems like a game. Quoting Buzzfeed News: “At Navient's call centers, Brittany said, managers sometimes tried to turn the pressure put onto their employees into a more lighthearted experience, creating competitions between teams. During March Madness, her managers created a bracket on the wall and had agents compete against one another to collect payments and resolve accounts.”",Point,images/march.png
American Dream,"College education, which has long been a key component of the American Dream, is now in risk as a result of tremendous student debt, which has turned into a financial cancer with potentially fatal effects for the entire country. Student debt not only puts a constant strain on millions of working-class families, but it also imposes a hidden cost on all Americans since it is a drag on the economy as a whole.
Since the year 2000, personal debt has increased dramatically. The average debt at graduation for four-year college students is now $36,693, nearly double what it was in 2001. (adjusted for inflation). The typical debt for graduate students is $59,000, up from $38,000 in 2004. More than 3.2 million Americans owe $100,000 or more on their student loans. Some people are perplexed as to how the American ideal of equal opportunity has deteriorated so drastically. Part of the solution lies in the way we fund higher education. Student debt has become an inextricable component of the American inequity narrative. Higher education, with strong public funding, was once the cornerstone of a system that promised opportunity to hardworking students of all backgrounds. We now have a pay-to-play, winner-take-all game in which the wealthiest are guaranteed a spot while the remainder are forced to wager on massive debts with no assurance of repayment.",Point,images/americandream.png
(Mis)Invested Potential Wealth,"Legacies and inheritance are possible because of the legislations that were passed that favored that demographic in the older times. Thanks to advancement in societal values and other laws that promoted equity and equality regarding the realm of education, more and more types of people could afford a college degree. But how could they pursue a good life with college degree if they are stuck paying huge amounts of debt? Such college graduates have a resource of potential wealth but instead of investing on a property to pass to a later generation or instead of spending that money on the economy, such people (mis)invest them instead to paying their loans’ monthly dues. And so the cycle begins again: they produce children, those children pursue a college degree, then gets buried in debt and so on and so forth.",Point,images/misinvestment.png
Best Colleges Magazine,"Following the tax revolt and the Raegan era in the 1980s, tuition and other related fees regarding higher education funding has been scrutinized. It was also during this time when the U.S. News and World Report published its first College ranking. In this highly data-driven magazine of college ranking, they considered such criteria for determining a college’s rank: name recognition, traditional quality, prestige, and wealth. This attracted many students to particular colleges. However, how could colleges pick their prospective applicants? The colleges relied on standardized testing scores and provided some students with merit-based scholarships. Nevertheless, tuition and fees at public and private universities doubled from 1988 to 2018. ",Point,images/ranking.jpg
Student Debt as Top Debt,"It's also helpful to know how much student debt costs (or rather, its ranking) in contrast to other types of debt that Americans take on. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that there is $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, which accounts for around 15% of all mortgage debt, based on credit bureau data rather than lender data. Between 2009 and 2010, however, student loan debt exceeded both auto loan and credit card debt. Student loan debt has now surpassed credit card debt by 70%. As student debt rises, it affects a greater number of Americans than ever before. The percentage of families with student loan debt climbed from 8.9% in 1989 to 22.3 percent in 2016, according to the Federal Reserve Bank Survey of Consumer Finances. After adjusted for inflation, the average amount of student loan debt for borrowers has more than tripled from $10,260 to $34,290 in that time. In 2016, the average amount of school debt held by families was over double that of vehicle loan debt and nearly six times that of credit card debt. In other words, for many American families, student loan debt has become the most substantial source of non-residential debt.",Point,images/studentdebt.png
Supernation Power,"Especially during the brawl against the USSR, the democratic agenda of America has been to prevail in all types of war against communism. With America’s world renowned status of being a superpower, America’s military capabilities has not only included the sheer number of its army, but also the quality of the innovations that foster such an army. That meant including a better funding on higher education and the types of people who could go and afford a college degree.",Point,images/imperialism.png
War On Poverty,"President Lyndon B Johnson’s initiative, War on Poverty, has paved the way for passing legislations that have promoted equity and equality for many people which involved many livelihood categories. One of those included betterment agenda on education.",Point,images/waronpoverty.png
Higher Education Act of 1965,"The Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) is a federal statute aimed at improving educational resources at US colleges and universities and providing financial aid to post-secondary students.
The Higher Education Act expanded government funding for post-secondary institutions, created scholarship programs, provided low-interest student loans, and established the National Teachers Corps. The Act was enacted into law on November 8, 1965, as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society domestic program.",Point,images/highereducation.png
Military Strength,"America wouldn’t be the country that is known internationally today if it weren’t for its military greatness. In order to prolong and promote this quality, particular legislations were often passed to mitigate the friction between serving the country as a troop and bettering one’s career through getting an education.",Point,images/military.png
Sputnik,"In the 1950s, a beachball-like satellite was launched into the space by the Soviet Union. This had a big impact on the American educational system. Following American reactions and the “lagging behind” mentality, numerous legislations were passed to encourage and promote the study of certain STEM disciplines; it was then suddenly patriotic for oneself to study the maths and the sciences. This allowed more and more types of people to achieve a higher education.",Point,images/sputnik.png
National Defense Education Act of 1958,"In reaction to the Soviet escalation of the space race with the launch of the satellite Sputnik, Congress approved the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) in 1958. The statute required the federal government to give financing to ""ensure trained workforce of adequate quality and quantity to meet the United States' national defense demands."" The Act bolstered education in the areas of science, mathematics, and modern foreign languages, in addition to providing fellowships and loans to students. ""It is no exaggeration to argue that America's development in many fields of effort in the years ahead—indeed, the very survival of our free country—may rest in great part on the education we offer for our young people now,"" according to the recommended passage on the law. The NDEA allowed more than $1 billion in funding over the next seven years to achieve its aims, making it the first example of comprehensive federal education law and foreshadowing the federal government's expanded engagement in citizen education.",Point,images/nationaldefense.png
GI Bill,"The G.I. Bill, formally known as the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, was intended to assist World War II veterans. It built hospitals, made low-interest mortgages available, and provided stipends to veterans attending college or trade schools to pay tuition and expenses. Roughly 9 million veterans earned nearly $4 billion in unemployment compensation from the bill's unemployment compensation program between 1944 and 1949. Until 1956, the education and training provisions were in place, and until 1962, the Veterans' Administration supplied insured loans. All veterans of the armed forces, even those who fought during peacetime, were eligible for these payments under the Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966.",Point,images/gibill.png
Income Based Repayment,"Borrowers who are having financial difficulties, have a low income compared to their debt, or are seeking a career in public service should use the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) option.
Income-based repayment is meant to be a substitute for income-sensitive repayment (ISR) and income-contingent repayment (ICR) (ICR). Its purpose is to make it easier for students who plan to pursue lower-paying employment, such as those in the public sector, to repay their college loans. The monthly payments are capped at a percentage of the borrower's discretionary income.",Point,images/income.png
Public Service Loan Forgiveness,"The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program forgives the remaining balance on your federal Direct Loans after one makes 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for a qualifying public service employer.
This program helps one to manage student loan debt while pursuing a career in public service. Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is available to many employees working in public service, including all levels of government, states and municipalities, school districts, public hospitals, qualifying non-profit organizations, and more.",Point,images/public.png
Forebearance,"Forbearance on student loans is a program that allows you to temporarily stop or lower your monthly payments. Forbearance on federal student loans normally lasts 12 months and has no maximum duration. That means you can ask for forbearance as many times as you wish, however service providers may limit how much you get.
It's neither a long-term budgeting technique or a way to postpone repayment indefinitely, thus only a small percentage of people should utilize it.
Consider forbearance as a last resort to avoid defaulting on your student loans.",Point,images/fore.png
Cutting the Banks,"For a long time, the government partnered up with banks to make loan interests to students. So if a student defaulted, the government was on the hook and not the banks. That changed in 2010 when the Obama administration cut out the banks as an “unnecessary middleman” where students could directly borrow money from the governments and not the banks. In Obama’s Student Loan Overhaul Legislation, Instead of allowing students to borrow directly from the federal government, the overhaul removed a preexisting scheme that compensated banks and other financial institutions for granting loans. Some borrowers' interest rates will be cut as well. As a result, rather than having banks utilize government funds to loan tuition, the government will directly lend the cash. According to officials, new federal student loans would be delivered and collected by private corporations under performance-based contracts with the Department of Education after the law was just approved.",Point, images/banks.png
State AGs,"Many state attorney generals nation-wide have been suing the Navient corporation of gross predatory practices as a loan servicer. In many of the lawsuits, unconscionable commercial practices, deceptive conduct, and misrepresentations when servicing thousands of consumers’ student loans have always been stated as allegations towards the infamous company.
",Point, images/state.png
Raegan ERA,"Reaganomics is a word that refers to Ronald Reagan's economic policies as the 40th President of the United States (1981–1989). His proposals were for broad tax cuts, reduced social spending, increased military budget, and domestic market liberalization. These policies were implemented in response to a long period of economic stagflation that began in 1976 under President Gerald Ford.
These views argue that lowering taxes, particularly for corporations, is the most effective approach to boost economic growth. The assumption is that if businesses cut costs, the savings will ""trickle down"" to the rest of the economy, boosting growth. George H. W. Bush, before becoming Reagan's vice president, invented the term ""voodoo economics"" as a proposed Reaganomics synonym.",Point, images/raegan.png
CFPB,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is suing the nation's largest servicer of federal and private student loans for failing borrowers at every level of repayment in a systematic and illegal manner. For years, Navient, formerly Sallie Mae, hampered repayment by giving inaccurate information, processing payments erroneously, and failing to respond to borrowers' complaints. The corporation also fraudulently tricked many suffering borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments through shortcuts and trickery, causing them to pay considerably more than they had to for their loans. The Bureau is attempting to obtain meaningful remedy for the borrowers who have been injured as a result of these illegal servicing failures.",Point, images/cfpb.png
Largest Bank: Dep't of Education,"According to the US Department of Education, cash dried up during the 2008 crisis, making loans more difficult to come by. Under the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act, the federal government began to purchase guaranteed student loans, which are loans offered by commercial banks but for which the federal government accepts the risk of default. The federal government then stopped guaranteeing private loans in 2010, opting instead to provide loans directly through the Department of Education, making the federal government the most popular financing option. The portfolio of the Department of Education would make it the country's fifth largest bank. However, federal regulatory authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service do not have jurisdiction over the Department.",Point, images/doe.png
Loan Servicers,"A federal student loan servicer acts as a liaison between a student and the federal government, which provided funding for your education.
Student loan servicers collect and track student loan bills to ensure that they are paid on schedule. They also assist borrowers in changing repayment schedules, applying for forgiveness programs, and deferring loan payments.
The servicer's job is to assist you in keeping your loans in good standing by providing you with the necessary support and resources. However, because they are private companies, they may make recommendations that are not in the best interests of the borrower.",Point,
Navient,"Navient was founded in 1973 as the Student Loan Marketing Association, a Government-Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) (nicknamed Sallie Mae). The company was established by Congress to assist the Higher Education Act of 1965's student loan program.
Sallie Mae's GSE charter was dissolved in 2004, and the firm became a private-sector company with an independent board of directors. Sallie Mae was chosen by the US Department of Education to service federal loans on its behalf in 2009. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 repealed the federally guaranteed loan program known as the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), which allowed banks and firms such as Sallie Mae to make loans to college students that were backed by a federal guarantee. As a result, beginning July 1, 2010, the US Department of Education originated all federal loans directly. Student loan borrowers sued Navient in 2021, attempting to put the company into bankruptcy. Navient announced on September 28, 2021 that it would stop processing federal student loans. Outstanding federal loans and chosen workers would be transferred to Maximus if the Department of Education gave its approval.",Point, images/navient.png
John Remondi,"Following its spin-off from Sallie Mae in April 2014, Remondi became the first CEO of the Navient Corporation. He was the CEO of Sallie Mae from May 2013 until joining Navient.   Remondi worked with Sallie Mae from 1999 to 2005 in a variety of financial roles, including Executive Vice President, Corporate Finance. In September 2017, Navient CEO Jack Remondi directly wrote a top adviser to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, encouraging her to ""immediately"" declare that states lacked the jurisdiction to regulate corporations that collect federal student loans. He described the timing as ""important,"" and expressed concern about the licensing fees that businesses would be required to pay to state regulators. Such emails showed how him and Betsy Devos have influenced the American educational system with their money and influence, despite immeasurable resistance. ",Point, images/john.png
Betsy DeVos,"Betsy DeVos is a former government figure who served as the 11th Secretary of Education of the United States from 2017 to 2021. DeVos is well-known for her support of school choice, vouchers programs, and charter schools. She was a member of the Republican National Committee for Michigan from 1992 to 1997 and the Michigan Republican Party's chair from 1996 to 2000, with reelection in 2003. Betsy DeVos has made it her personal goal to gut public education. She supported the privatization of public schools through vouchers, called for substantial cuts to government funding on a regular basis, rolled down protections for vulnerable children, and entirely disregarded their safety and the safety of instructors during the pandemic.",Point, images/betsy.png
Cuts in Higher Education Funding,"Conservative Republicans were able to defeat those efforts thanks to Congress' growing preference for offering student and parent loans, as well as a rising tax revolt, which left us with a system built on bipartisan promises of unprecedented accessibility that has kept millions in debt for decades. This was not always the case. Americans' college aspirations led lawmakers to reconsider their long-standing reluctance to directly support postsecondary education and truly make higher education cheap for a brief period in the middle of the twentieth century. The federal government has never contemplated bailing out failing colleges. In the early 1930s, however, they couldn't ignore the demands of many Americans for greater education. Citizens' zeal and ability persuaded New Dealers that the country's recovery need a better educated people capable of propelling the country forward as an international power.",Point,images/cuts.png
Recessions,"High debt levels may also make it more difficult for student loan borrowers if the economy is hit by larger causes, such as the Great Recession of 2008 or the COVID-19 epidemic. It has been stated that student loans make it more difficult to weather economic downturns or recessions; the more debt a person has, the less money they will have in savings and reserves to offset any gap during a slowdown. Recessions doesn’t just affect people in a microscopic level; it also gets translated at a macro scope too. When enough funding dries up and some departments are prioritized than education, state-based public education loses funding that will lead to higher tuition prices. Typically, public universities could take in students, but if not enough spaces are given, those universities reject students and those students go to other alternatives like for-profit universities.",Point, images/house.png
Online Education,"According to the College Board, it cost students on average $17,410 to attend a private institution and $7,900 to attend a public college during the 1980-1981 school year, including tuition, fees, and room and board. These costs had risen to $26,050 and $9,800, respectively, by 1990. As expenses rose, lawmakers searched for new ways to increase access while reducing government spending.  The Bush administration made it a lot easier for online education to expand in the early 2000s and that had an impact on a lot of huge for-profit institutions in the mid-2000s, which increased their enrollment by several orders of magnitude. At its peak, the for-profit sector accounted for just over 10% of total enrollment, but a quarter of Pell Grants, a third of student loans, and more than half of all defaults.",Point, images/online.png
Gov't + Banks Partnership,"The Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program was a federal government-backed system of private student loans that were subsidized and guaranteed. The program provided loans from 1965 through 2010, when it was terminated. The Federal Direct Student Loan Program, which are federal loans granted directly by the US Department of Education, currently offers similar loans. The Higher Education Act of 1965 established the FFEL, which was funded through a public-private partnership administered at the state and local levels. FFEL serviced 6.5 million students and parents in 2007-08, lending $54.7 billion in new loans (or 80 percent of all new federal student loans). FFEL loans have been used to pay for college expenses by 60 million Americans since 1965. The program was terminated with the enactment of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 on January 5, 2010, and no further loans were permitted under the program after June 30, 2010.",Point,images/gov.png
Aggressive Debt Collection,"Loan servicers like Navient have a reputation for being too aggressive when it comes to debt collection. They were aggressive in their efforts by: leaving messages that illegally disclosed information about a person's debts to other people without the debtor's permission; calling people multiple times after being told that the person who answered did not owe the debt, that they had called the wrong person, or that the person they wanted could not be reached there; and falsely claiming that the company would take steps to make its employees from making unlawful calls to their customers. ",Point, images/collector.png
For-Profit Universities,"For-profit universities are more costly and ineffective. When compared to alternative kinds of postsecondary education, there is a mountain of data indicating for-profit colleges result in more debt and lower job market outcomes for students. Only 10% of students attend for-profit universities, but they account for half of all student loan defaults. For-profit college students borrow 71 percent of federal loans, but 4-year public school students borrow only 49 percent. For-profit college students borrow roughly $2,000 more than 4-year public school students. These disparities in borrowing aren't due to variances in student populations; rather, they're due to the fact that the average tuition at a for-profit college is almost $10,000 greater than at a public community college. Do the outcomes of for-profit college students on the job market justify the higher costs? The answer is simple: no. For-profit colleges consistently underperform their peer universities on a variety of measures. When socioeconomic inequalities among students are taken into account, study after study indicates that for-profit college graduates' incomes and employment rates are lower (or at best similar) to those of public college and non-profit college graduates. Even when comparing for-profit college graduates with associate's degrees to high school graduates who did not pursue a postsecondary education, there is little evidence that they earn more.",Point, images/profit.png
Dep't of Education,"Over the years the Department of Education has been known to be incompetent. In 2019, one of the biggest teacher union in the nation sued the DoE. The suit alleges that a program designed to forgive to help millions of public servants is in such a disarray that it’s illegal. The program known as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness encouraged people to work in public service (ie nurse, firefighter, governmental staff, etc.) for ten years that will forgive their student loan debt. More than a million have filed an official paperwork for their program but the Dep’t of Education can’t seem to work it all together. Back in 2017, almost 28,000 people submitted their applications for their debt to be forgiven — but due to the incompetence of the Dep’t of Education, only 96 applications were approved. ",Point, images/doe.png
(Mis/Dis)Informed Financial Advice,"In loan servicing companies like Navient, such companies often prioritize maximizing profits rather than their mission to help students find the right financial path. In some instances, it is typical for their employees to conduct customer service of “seven minutes or less.” With that being said, a loan servicer might recommend a financial option that advances the company’s interest rather than the students’ interest to better loan options. ",Point,  images/fin.png
Incompetence,"In this student loan industry, it is possible for a party to be incompetent. It may also be possible for such parties to be complicit. Whether such perspective offers the more correct jurisdiction, the cycle of blame continues to go on as new figures to act as scapegoats continue to emerge.",Point,
